# AutoWeb: Selenium Automation Framework

AutoWeb is a Python-based automation framework using **Selenium WebDriver** to automate tasks like logging into websites, performing searches, and interacting with web elements. It's designed for web scraping, automated testing, and performing repetitive web tasks efficiently.

## Features
- Automates website login and search interactions.
- Supports headless mode for background execution.
- Uses XPath and CSS Selectors for dynamic element interaction.
- Securely handles credentials with environment variables (recommended over hardcoding).

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver (required for Chrome browser automation)
- Chrome Options (for headless execution)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   
## Code Explanation
login_to_website(): Logs in by filling out email and password fields.
search_and_interact(): Performs a search and clicks the first result.
Headless Mode: Runs without browser UI when enabled.
Dynamic Element Handling: Uses XPath and CSS Selectors for reliable element targeting.

## Best Practices
Credential Security: Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use environment variables for sensitive data.
Explicit Waits: Use WebDriverWait instead of time.sleep() for more reliable execution.
